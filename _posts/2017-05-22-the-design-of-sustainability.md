In recent years, the world has come to view the environment as something significantly more delicate than anything our ancestors could have imagined. Since around the time of the first industrial revolution, it has been discovered that the end results of our breakthroughs in technology have been negatively impacting our environment in countless ways, ranging from the obviousness of pure waste being dumped into water to changes in deep ocean currents, a problem that has only just been discovered in the last couple of years. With the majority of the American population attuned to the scientific, political, and business aspects of the modern-day environmental situation, it seems as if all the bases of concern have been met.

Design practices in general have been extremely low key for the last twenty or so years, only recently being made widely recognized by the onset of many high-profile companies selling incredibly designed products with sustainable aspects to them. What most people don’t know is that designers and architects have been pushing for sustainable-minded thinking and condemning wasteful design as early as the 60s and 20s respectively, long before scientists really knew about climate change. These concepts were exemplified in many modernist practices, such as chairs built using as little material as possible, or the entire line of Braun products designed along the principles Dieter Rams created. With sustainability being an important issue to face at present and in upcoming years, design practices have become the forefront of the push to achieve sustainability on all levels of human – environmental interaction.

When it comes down to it’s core, almost all environmental problems stem from the usage of limited natural resources, the pollution generated from vehicles and mass-produced products, and the tendency for designers to ideate non-reusable products. Being key players in the creation of mass-produced products, designers and architects in particular must take up the responsibility of designing a world in which we give back to the earth, rather than take from it. In this sense, designers of the near future will be the people responsible for the re-creation of an entirely different culture in which every product goes towards the betterment of the world, both in function and in environmental impact.  

The environmentally conscious mindsets of designers have been key in shaping many present-day business models of companies who propagate sustainable methods of organizing their businesses. Unfortunately, compared to the large amount of existing large companies in the world, very few have truly taken steps to reduce their footprint on the environment, usually due to a lack of governmental pressure to do so. Despite the relatively few amounts of truly sustainable businesses, it’s interesting to make note that many surveyed workers believe that slowly but surely, their companies are moving towards a greener mode of operation. Take for example, the recent survey examining engineers and their opinions of their own companies’ sustainability - despite the low numbers of truly sustainable companies, engineers “expected that no matter what, the companies they work for would have an increasingly large involvement with green or sustainable design specifications over the next year.” (Winters) Surveys similar to the one mentioned have been key in determining the changing business climate of companies across the world.  Fully integrated with politics, economics, and design practice, the gradual shift of businesses to greener models is an incredibly welcome sign for those who support sustainable practices.

Economically, the issue of sustainability has been widely contested by observers of current business models, primarily on the assumption that sustainable practices would impact the economy in a negative way. Despite the work of designers and architects who prove the use of cheap alternatives in both designed products and designed strategies, there are many people who feel America’s current economic direction is fine, and in fact necessary to promote further business, and by extension, “a never-ending drive for efficiency and innovation.” (Charles) While the idea of practicing our current model of capitalism can be viewed as the driving force (money) behind innovation, the fact of the matter is that earth is now known to be incredibly limited in its resources available for people to use.

Both sustainability and capitalism are deeply interrelated in this manner, as both deal with the use of resources on a human and natural scale. It has been noted that capitalism is ‘at a crossroads’ and soon in the very near future America will be deciding the direction we will be headed in regards to sustainability. As Al Gore and David Blood stated in their essay, Current Global Business Practices Harm the Environment, “The interests of shareholders, over time, will be best served by companies that maximize their financial performance by strategically managing their economic, social, environmental and ethical performance. This is increasingly true as we confront the limits of our ecological system to hold up under current patterns of use. "License to operate" can no longer be taken for granted by business as challenges such as climate change, HIV/AIDS, water scarcity and poverty have reached a point where civil society is demanding a response from business and government.”

While the prevailing idea of a designer is of an incredibly ingenious superior who directs all creative work on a project, the reality is that the ‘star designer’ no longer exists anymore. More and more has design become a communal experience, a shared job between many people. Likewise with the problem of unsustainability, we as a human race cannot rely on the few to ‘design’ us out of a strategy, or let the few politicians and businessmen direct the future of all the people they serve. As hokey as the idea is, true sustainability is something that can only come out of the combined effort of all people, just from actions as simple as merely recycling. Chad Tragakis is a businessman who wrote on the issue of sustainability and it’s impact on business in the near future. In closing his essay, he wrote, “an ethic that has been popular with outdoors enthusiasts since time immemorial – that is to leave the natural places we visit better than we found them.”  Perhaps someday we as a human race will one day adopt the same idea, and sustain ourselves and finally give back to our planet everything it has given to us.
