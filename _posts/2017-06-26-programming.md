_First in a series of personal notes on learning programming_

The spirit of the computer.

The spirit.

The spirit, an un-measurable thing.

A year-old copy of Structure and Interpetation of Computer Programs had been sitting around on my bookshelf in a very unused state. While I had been working at IBM, I bumbled about obscure programming nooks and forums online, slowly receiving a drip-feed of best practices and good places to start with regards to "DIY Computer Science". After much aimless bookmarking and getting nowhere in my studies, I figured only the aquisition of a proper tome would do me any good, and force me to learn. Cut-away to the current scene: the legendary purple wizard book, unused and forgotten.

Three weeks ago, armed with a resolve to teach myself how to think like a programmer (in light of the further stagnation of most digital design practices and tooling), I picked the tome back up and have been attempting to read it on my daily morning commute. New York and the need to travel via public transport has proven to be an excellent catalyst to my recent ability to _actually_ consume texts that have been lying around for years, but when I think of this, I realize the problem is likely to reside within myself, and transportation is just an excuse. All things said, I heavily dislike the need to own and use personal transport in the American Southwest, but I digress.

The spirit of the computer.

What is the spirit of the computer? According to the [tome](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html#%_chap_1):

> _A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform._
> 
> _A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences._

This passage struck me deeply, and caused me great distress, to an extent. Programming is such a high level exercise with regards to the actual machinations of electricity and conducting materials. The retaining of state at such a low level is, on one hand, a simple matter of the binary — on the other hand, the natural nuance of electric forces and their non-binary and violent nature lends me the shadow of a thought: "We truly are dealing with spirits and demons otherwise, when it comes down to it."

None of this is particularly revelatory, or new, or groundbreaking. It's such a powerful sentiment though, in my daily learning. What is being manipulated as one programs? How does the representation of a concept map itself to captured natural forces residing in a machine?
