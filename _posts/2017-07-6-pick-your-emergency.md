Context: I've been reading a lot about cities (among other urbanist works) and what do do about them — 

I came across an interesting prompt/question, posed via _The New Normal_, by Benjamin H. Bratton:

> _"So, again, pick your emergency (electron distribution, value exchange, protein capture, carbon dioxide storage, etc.) What is actually worth what to whom: how much value is there in the world and why? What should be done with the cities, now?"_
>

These are my answers to a few of these prompts:

My emergency:

> 1.) Over-consumption of limited resources and 2.) "eggs in one basket" regarding centralized planetary habitation.

What is worth what to whom?:

> I'm actually not sure how to answer this!

How much value is there in the world? Why?

> I don't know if 'Value' is a means by which we can measure the world, or anything in it. Why does anything in the world need to be ascribed a value? (Do we need to ascribe value as a function of being conscious things with limited life spans?) By which measure is an arbitrary value 'successful' or 'unsuccessful'?

What should be done with cities now?

> We should nurture cities, because they are precious. We should grow cities in a manner that best supports the surrounding earth/planet. Cities should bring out the best of compact, dense, information-rich living contexts, and reduce the worst that is brought out by people living in close proximity with one another. We should find methods by which we can grow many more cities that take less from the world. The spirit of a city should be accessible to anyone, regardless of whether they live in a city or not.
